My friend and I nervously agree, as he is too close for comfort.

I'm not necessarily worried about losing life through Firedrinker Satyr, but I am worried about getting 2-for-1'ed at an inopportune moment, which is something I've done to other people running that card. If I'm playing Cackler over anybody, it's Foundry Street Denizen. I've gone back and forth over that decision many times, and the reason I'm going with Foundry Street Denizen is that it's common for him to hit for a lot following a BTE chain. As for Legion Loyalist, his Battalion ability has proven itself many times, even after rotation meant I didn't see token decks as much. Plus, he's a really powerful answer to board wipe when paired with a Madcap Skills. Not once have I ever lost a game with that card that I would have won with a Rakdos Cackler instead."

I'm developing JS and testing webpages with Firefox. But I don't use it for my daily browsing, because that interferes with my development customizations. Is there a good way to use Firfox for both? Here is a small list of differences between the two instances: - Firefox for Development: Firebug extension, browser.cache.check_doc_frequency=1, custom privacy settings and ""clear history when Firefox closes"". But, as an example, no Adblock extension. No specific bookmarks needed. - Firefox for Browsing: Other extensions like Adblock (but no Firebug), different lighter custom privacy settings, browser.cache.check_doc_frequency=default. Bookmarks needed. I'm a bit rigid with the customizations of the Firefox Development. To avoid caching side-effects and to start with a clean cache/cookie state, I clean all of it when I close it. Of course, that makes ""daily browsing"" a bit cumbersome. It may happen that both ""instances"" are running the same time. Developing on Firefox 1 and looking documentation and searching on Firefox 2. Using different profiles shouldn't therefore work (do they?). Is there a way to accomplish this? Maybe with two different installations or for example Firefox and a differnt clone (but which one which is similar)?"

Both of these stories are relatively short, so I decided to just combine them into one post. They both take place at a Drunkin' Fauxnuts, though two different locations. In my first tale, I stopped in for a coffee on my way to school. I always ordered a large iced, flavored, coffee with cream and sugar. Occasionally, the cashier would inform me that the flavoring was already sweetened since I'd ordered sugar, and I always said that I would still like the added sugar. On this wonderful day, however, our conversation went like so: ""Hi! Can I please have a large iced pumpkin coffee with cream and sugar?"" ""Oh, the pumpkin spice is already sweetened."" ""That's okay, I'd still like the sugar, please."" ""But the pumpkin spice is already sweetened."" ""...I'm aware of that. I still want the sugar, thanks."" ""No."" wtfdidthisbitchjust In my stunned silence, she sort of chuckles to herself and says, ""Oh, I understand! Let me get that for you."" I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. She had a pretty thick accent. It was early, I was tired. Perhaps it was all just a misunderstanding. Nope. I watched her make my drink and she didn't add any sugar. I grabbed a couple sugar packets and opened them. I then stopped her for a second and asked to see the coffee before she put on a lid. She looked a little confused, but came over with the coffee. As soon as she set it down, I emptied the sugar packets right into the coffee. ""Thanks!"" I said brightly, ""May I have a lid now, please?"" She gave me the lid, I put it on my coffee and left. I seriously had no idea what to even do with that experience. To just bluntly tell me no when you're in the damn service industry is appalling. I used to work in a privately owned coffeehouse, and if a customer wanted me to add 2.5 sugar packets, 1.75 tablespoons of flavoring, and wanted their milk steamed to 140 degrees, allowed to cool to 100, and then steamed again to 170, I would fucking do it. I didn't raise a stink over her or anything, but it really rustled my jimmies for the rest of the morning. Onto Tale #2! Reminder that this is a different location than in Tale #1 I was heading to work and decided to stop in for some coffee and a sandwich with my boyfriend. After I ordered my sandwich, the cashier asked if I wanted to add hashbrowns. I thought for a second and decided that I did want them. The cashier says, ""Okay, your total is $15.14 (embellishing the prices here, I don't remember things that specifically)."" I give her my card, she swipes it, gives me a receipt and I move down to the pick-up end of the counter with the boyfriend. While waiting, I looked at my receipt and saw that I'd been charged $16.75 rather than the $15.14 I was told. I got the attention of an employee not currently making anything for a customer and told her about the problem. I was calm and everything, I don't get too worked up over less than $2, I just wanted to point out that they shouldn't tell people they're going to be charged one amount and then end up getting charged extra. She came back and our conversation when something like this: ""Okay, the problem is that you added hashbrowns. They cost an extra dollar."" ""Well, that's fine. I'm just saying that I was told I was being charged less than I actually was."" ""Yes, it's because you ordered the hashbrowns, which cost an extra dollar."" ""I don't think you're understanding me. I don't mind being charged a dollar more for the hashbrowns. My issue lies specifically with the cashier telling me I would be charged $15.14 and then charging my card $16.75."" ""Here, why don't I refund the $1 for you."" ""That's completely unnecessary. I want the hashbrowns, and I'll pay for them. You just can't charge people more after telling them their total."" She just apologized, walked off, and came back with the $1 and change from the tax. Of course, I didn't get my hashbrowns, either. :( I know these aren't too bad. I just wanted to share a couple of lighthearted stories from a customer who gets a laugh out of them now."

As for department funsies, they can only be out of the armory for department use, so I wouldn't be able to just have a range day with it. However, one of the deputies stopped by during handgun training the other day since he is the armorer and function-checked on of the SD's select-fire ARs. I guess the local PD has three select-fire ARs, too, and at one point had an MP5. Not sure if they still do or not, though. The chief almost got a Glock 18, too, but figured the ammo costs weren't worth it. It's actually pretty great being in a town where both the PD and SD are packed full of gun-loving personnel. No one gets hassled for open-carrying here, they generally know what they're talking about, and the ones I've seen shoot have all been pretty dang good shots.

I tried listening to that video all the way through but it was full of projection, talk about how games suck, women developers hate working on them (nonsense), they need to be created by more ""diverse"" peoples. From listening to him I began to realize why he hates games. Most people are happy with their vidya, but ever since he took SJW mantle his own perception of the world had become increasingly polarized, warped into black and white - his food tasted bland, he saw imaginary oppression everywhere, and his vidya sucked because it triggered all of his SJW programming for ""RAAAAAAPE"". Video games didn't suddenly start to suck and then SJWs came in like white knights to save them from their own demise. That's a bullshit narrative. In reality, *gamers who became SJWs suck and now they're trying to spread their own misery into games.* I have a few ex-friends, also gamers, who fell into that camp. And I say ""ex-friends"" because SJWs are incredibly depressing to be around. They're whiny, entitled and they complain about *everything*. So many of them are just unsuccessful at life, embittered, and are looking for a way to blame everyone else. Many of these so-called ""game journalists"" are simply using games as a conversation piece, a prop and a punching bag to vent their own personal SJW microaggressions. That have everything to do with their own attitude and little if anything to do with games."

I had him for the first semester of my sophomore year. When the winter holidays rolled around, I had no one to take care of him, so I made plans to look up what I needed to do to take him with me on the flight home. I could find nothing about fish on the airline website, only cats and dogs. I tried calling for information, but came up empty handed. So I did my best, got him a large, clear, unbreakable container and got him prepped for the trip. When I got to the check in desk, the attendant told me I couldn't take him. She even printed out the same pages of the airline rules I'd seen online (which were only regarding what kind of carrier and weight limits wereneeded for cats and dogs, not anything saying other pets were not allowed). She kept telling me I should look around the airport, maybe I could find a family to give him to. (what? Are there not constant recordings playing telling everyone to do exactly the opposite?) It was also pretty late, so there weren't many people in the airport even if that wasn't crazy talk. She refused to let me check in with my fish. So I did the only tong I could do, I left little Cornelius on the counter in a restroom, thinking maybe a janitor would take him home or something, even though I knew a flushing was more likely. I boarded my plane and what do you know? In my row, one seat away from me was another girl from my school with A RED BETA IN HER LAP. I went from being devastated to enraged pretty quickly."
